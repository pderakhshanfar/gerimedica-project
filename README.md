## Development process
I try to perform TDD for this assignment. 
Although, due to the shortage of time I will do only with high-level testing (i.e., endpoint testing). 
Hence, I will first right the test for the first requirement, and then I will implement it.
I continue this process iteratively for each requirement.
I continue adding tests in different levels if I still have time.


__List of implemented sytem-level tests:__

- testEmptyGetAll: This test make sure that the API returns an empty list when we dont upload the CSV.
